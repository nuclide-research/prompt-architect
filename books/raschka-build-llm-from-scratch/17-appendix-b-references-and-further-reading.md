## Chapter 2

Readers who are interested in discussion and comparison of embedding spaces with latent spaces and the general notion of vector representations can find more information in the first chapter of my book:

- Machine Learning Q and AI (2023) by Sebastian Raschka, [https://leanpub.com/machine-learning-q-and-ai](https://leanpub.com/machine-learning-q-and-ai)

The following paper provides more in-depth discussions of how byte pair encoding is used as a tokenization method:

- “Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units” (2015) by Sennrich et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909)

The code for the byte pair encoding tokenizer used to train GPT-2 was open-sourced by OpenAI:

- [https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py)

OpenAI provides an interactive web UI to illustrate how the byte pair tokenizer in GPT models works:

- [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

For readers interested in coding and training a BPE tokenizer from the ground up, Andrej Karpathy’s GitHub repository `minbpe` offers a minimal and readable implementation:

- “A Minimal Implementation of a BPE Tokenizer,” [https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe)

- “Fast WordPiece Tokenization” (2020) by Song et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15524)

## Chapter 3

Readers interested in learning more about Bahdanau attention for RNN and language translation can find detailed insights in the following paper:

- “A Minimal Implementation of a BPE Tokenizer,” [https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe)

The concept of self-attention as scaled dot-product attention was introduced in the original transformer paper:

- “Attention Is All You Need” (2017) by Vaswani et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

FlashAttention is a highly efficient implementation of a self-attention mechanism, which accelerates the computation process by optimizing memory access patterns. FlashAttention is mathematically the same as the standard self-attention mechanism but optimizes the computational process for efficiency:

- “FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness” (2022) by Dao et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)
- “FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning” (2023) by Dao, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691)

PyTorch implements a function for self-attention and causal attention that supports FlashAttention for efficiency. This function is beta and subject to change:

- `scaled_dot_product_attention` documentation: [https://mng.bz/NRJd](https://mng.bz/NRJd)

PyTorch also implements an efficient `MultiHeadAttention` class based on the `scaled_` `dot_product` function:

- `MultiHeadAttention` documentation: [https://mng.bz/DdJV](https://mng.bz/DdJV)

Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training:

- “Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting” (2014) by Srivastava et al., [https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)

While using the multi-head attention based on scaled-dot product attention remains the most common variant of self-attention in practice, authors have found that it’s possible to also achieve good performance without the value weight matrix and projection layer:

- “Simplifying Transformer Blocks” (2023) by He and Hofmann, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01906)

## Chapter 4

The following paper introduces a technique that stabilizes the hidden state dynamics neural networks by normalizing the summed inputs to the neurons within a hidden layer, significantly reducing training time compared to previously published methods:

- “Layer Normalization” (2016) by Ba, Kiros, and Hinton, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450)

Post-LayerNorm, used in the original transformer model, applies layer normalization after the self-attention and feed forward networks. In contrast, Pre-LayerNorm, as adopted in models like GPT-2 and newer LLMs, applies layer normalization before these components, which can lead to more stable training dynamics and has been shown to improve performance in some cases, as discussed in the following papers:

- “On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture” (2020) by Xiong et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04745](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04745)
- “ResiDual: Transformer with Dual Residual Connections” (2023) by Tie et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14802)

A popular variant of LayerNorm used in modern LLMs is RMSNorm due to its improved computing efficiency. This variant simplifies the normalization process by normalizing the inputs using only the root mean square of the inputs, without subtracting the mean before squaring. This means it does not center the data before computing the scale. RMSNorm is described in more detail in

- “Root Mean Square Layer Normalization” (2019) by Zhang and Sennrich, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467)

The Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function combines the properties of both the classic ReLU activation function and the normal distribution’s cumulative distribution function to model layer outputs, allowing for stochastic regularization and nonlinearities in deep learning models:

- “Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)” (2016) by Hendricks and Gimpel, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415)

The GPT-2 paper introduced a series of transformer-based LLMs with varying sizes—124 million, 355 million, 774 million, and 1.5 billion parameters:

- “Language Models Are Unsupervised Multitask Learners” (2019) by Radford et al., [http://mng.bz/DMv0](http://mng.bz/DMv0)

OpenAI’s GPT-3 uses fundamentally the same architecture as GPT-2, except that the largest version (175 billion) is 100x larger than the largest GPT-2 model and has been trained on much more data. Interested readers can refer to the official GPT-3 paper by OpenAI and the technical overview by Lambda Labs, which calculates that training GPT-3 on a single RTX 8000 consumer GPU would take 665 years:

- “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners” (2023) by Brown et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
- “OpenAI’s GPT-3 Language Model: A Technical Overview,” [https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3)

NanoGPT is a code repository with a minimalist yet efficient implementation of a GPT-2 model, similar to the model implemented in this book. While the code in this book is different from nanoGPT, this repository inspired the reorganization of a large GPT Python parent class implementation into smaller submodules:

- “NanoGPT, a Repository for Training Medium-Sized GPTs, [https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)

An informative blog post showing that most of the computation in LLMs is spent in the feed forward layers rather than attention layers when the context size is smaller than 32,000 tokens is:

Chapter 5 discusses the pretraining of LLMs, and appendix D covers more advanced training functions, such as linear warmup and cosine annealing. The following paper finds that similar techniques can be successfully applied to continue pretraining already pretrained LLMs, along with additional tips and insights:

- “BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance” (2023) by Wu et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564)

GaLore is a recent research project that aims to make LLM pretraining more efficient. The required code change boils down to just replacing PyTorch’s `AdamW` optimizer in the training function with the `GaLoreAdamW` optimizer provided by the `galore-torch` Python package:

- “GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection” (2024) by Zhao et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507)

- “Hierarchical Neural Story Generation” (2018) by Fan et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04833](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04833)

An alternative to top-k sampling is top-p sampling (not covered in chapter 5), which selects from the smallest set of top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold *p*, while top-k sampling picks from the top *k* tokens by probability:

- Top-p sampling, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-p_sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-p_sampling)

Beam search (not covered in chapter 5) is an alternative decoding algorithm that generates output sequences by keeping only the top-scoring partial sequences at each step to balance efficiency and quality:

Additional experiments, including a comparison of fine-tuning the first output token versus the last output token, can be found in the supplementary code material on GitHub:

- Additional spam classification experiments, [https://mng.bz/AdJx](https://mng.bz/AdJx)

For a binary classification task, such as spam classification, it is technically possible to use only a single output node instead of two output nodes, as I discuss in the following article:

- “Losses Learned—Optimizing Negative Log-Likelihood and Cross-Entropy in PyTorch,” [https://mng.bz/ZEJA](https://mng.bz/ZEJA)

You can find additional experiments on fine-tuning different layers of an LLM in the following article, which shows that fine-tuning the last transformer block, in addition to the output layer, improves the predictive performance substantially:

GPT-2 is a model based on the decoder module of the transformer architecture, and its primary purpose is to generate new text. As an alternative, encoder-based models such as BERT and RoBERTa can be effective for classification tasks:

- “BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding” (2018) by Devlin et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

- “Additional Experiments Classifying the Sentiment of 50k IMDb Movie Reviews,” [https://mng.bz/PZJR](https://mng.bz/PZJR)

Recent papers are showing that the classification performance can be further improved by removing the causal mask during classification fine-tuning alongside other modifications:

- “Label Supervised LLaMA Finetuning” (2023) by Li et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01208)

## Chapter 7

The Alpaca dataset for instruction fine-tuning contains 52,000 instruction–response pairs and is one of the first and most popular publicly available datasets for instruction fine-tuning:

- “Stanford Alpaca: An Instruction-Following Llama Model,” [https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)

Additional publicly accessible datasets suitable for instruction fine-tuning include

- LIMA, [https://huggingface.co/datasets/GAIR/lima](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GAIR/lima)
  - For more information, see “LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment,” Zhou et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206)

- An Alpaca-like dataset with 52,000 instruction–response pairs generated with GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5

Phi-3 is a 3.8-billion-parameter model with an instruction-fine-tuned variant that is reported to be comparable to much larger proprietary models, such as GPT-3.5:

- “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone” (2024) by Abdin et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219)

Researchers propose a synthetic instruction data generation method that generates 300,000 high-quality instruction-response pairs from an instruction fine-tuned Llama-3 model. A pretrained Llama 3 base model fine-tuned on these instruction examples performs comparably to the original instruction fine-tuned Llama-3 model:

- “Magpie: Alignment Data Synthesis from Scratch by Prompting Aligned LLMs with Nothing” (2024) by Xu et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08464)

Research has shown that not masking the instructions and inputs in instruction fine-tuning effectively improves performance on various NLP tasks and open-ended generation benchmarks, particularly when trained on datasets with lengthy instructions and brief outputs or when using a small number of training examples:

- “Instruction Tuning with Loss Over Instructions” (2024) by Shi, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14394)

Prometheus and PHUDGE are openly available LLMs that match GPT-4 in evaluating long-form responses with customizable criteria. We don’t use these because at the time of this writing, they are not supported by Ollama and thus cannot be executed efficiently on a laptop:

- “Prometheus: Inducing Finegrained Evaluation Capability in Language Models” (2023) by Kim et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491)
- “PHUDGE: Phi-3 as Scalable Judge” (2024) by Deshwal and Chawla, “[https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08029](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08029)
- “Prometheus 2: An Open Source Language Model Specialized in Evaluating Other Language Models” (2024), by Kim et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01535)

The results in the following report support the view that large language models primarily acquire factual knowledge during pretraining and that fine-tuning mainly enhances their efficiency in using this knowledge. Furthermore, this study explores how fine-tuning large language models with new factual information affects their ability to use preexisting knowledge, revealing that models learn new facts more slowly and their introduction during fine-tuning increases the model’s tendency to generate incorrect information:

- “Does Fine-Tuning LLMs on New Knowledge Encourage Hallucinations?” (2024) by Gekhman, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05904)

Preference fine-tuning is an optional step after instruction fine-tuning to align the LLM more closely with human preferences. The following articles by the author provide more information about this process:

- “LLM Training: RLHF and Its Alternatives,” [https://mng.bz/ZVPm](https://mng.bz/ZVPm)

This appendix covers DDP, which is a popular approach for training deep learning models across multiple GPUs. For more advanced use cases where a single model doesn’t fit onto the GPU, you may also consider PyTorch’s Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) method, which performs distributed data parallelism and distributes large layers across different GPUs. For more information, see this overview with further links to the API documentation:
